Azure Partner Linker

A PowerShell script for managing the Microsoft Partner ID (MPN ID) linkage on Azure customer tenants.

üìñ Description

This script provides a user-friendly menu to connect to an Azure tenant using a Service Principal and then manage the Partner ID association. This is crucial for Microsoft Partners to get credit for their work and be eligible for incentives and rewards. The script handles authentication, module installation, and all relevant Partner ID operations (CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete) in an interactive way. A log file is automatically created in the user's home directory ($env:USERPROFILE\azure_script_log.txt) to record all actions.

‚ú® Features

    Interactive Menus: Simple and clear menus guide the user through the login and management process.

    Service Principal Authentication: Securely connects to the customer's Azure tenant without needing user credentials.

    Automatic Module Check: Automatically checks if the required PowerShell modules (Az.Accounts, Az.ManagementPartner) are installed and installs them if they are missing.

    Comprehensive Partner ID Management:

        Set (link) a new Partner ID.

        Get (view) the currently linked Partner ID.

        Update an existing Partner ID.
